# 📧 Email Notifications Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up email notifications for booking confirmations in the Ride Along application.

## 🚀 Features

- **Passenger Confirmation**: Beautiful HTML email with all trip and driver details
- **Driver Notification**: Email to driver with new passenger information
- **Professional Templates**: Well-designed email templates with all necessary information
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if emails fail to send
- **Email Status Tracking**: Real-time feedback on email delivery success/failure

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Gmail Configuration

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account Settings → Security
   - Under "2-Step Verification", click on "App passwords"
   - Select "Mail" and generate a password
   - Copy the 16-character password (format: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

# Other configurations...
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your-recaptcha-secret-key
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

## 🧪 Testing Email Configuration

### Test Email Setup
Access the test endpoint to verify your email configuration:

```bash
# Test if email configuration is working
curl http://localhost:5000/api/bookings/test-email
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email configuration is valid"
}
```

### Check Server Logs
When testing emails, check the server console for detailed logs:

```
📧 Attempting to send booking confirmation email...
✅ Email transporter verified successfully
📧 Sending email to: user@example.com
✅ Booking confirmation email sent successfully to: user@example.com
📧 Message ID: <message-id@gmail.com>
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. "Invalid login" Error
**Problem**: Authentication failed with Gmail
**Solution**: 
- Verify 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account
- Regenerate the app password
- Ensure you're using the app password, not your Gmail password
- Check EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD in .env file

### 2. "Connection timeout" Error
**Problem**: Network or SMTP connection issues
**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Gmail SMTP settings (should be automatic with `service: 'gmail'`)
- Try switching to a different network

### 3. Emails not received
**Problem**: Emails sent but not received
**Solution**:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify the recipient email address
- Check Gmail's "Sent" folder to confirm emails were sent
- Enable debug mode for detailed logs

### 4. "Authentication error" in production
**Problem**: Works locally but fails in production
**Solution**:
- Verify environment variables are set in production
- Check that app password is correctly configured
- Ensure no trailing spaces in environment variables

## 🔍 Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by adding to your .env file:

```env
DEBUG=nodemailer:*
NODE_ENV=development
```

This will show detailed SMTP communication logs.
